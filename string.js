/*
Now before we move on here, let's just stop for a second
and understand why all of this actually works. So we know 
that strings are just primitives. So why do they have methods?
Shouldn't methods only be available on objects such as a race?
Well that is actually true. However, JavaScript is really 
smart. And so here is how this works. Whenever we call a 
method on a string, JavaScript will automatically behind 
the scenes convert that string primitive to a string object
with the same content. And then it's on that object  where 
the methods are called. And then when the operation is done
the object is converted back to a regular string primitive. 
and this process is called boxing.
