/*
in sets there are actually no indexes. And in 
fact, there is no way of getting values out of 
a set. And if we think about this, then it makes 
sense. So there's really no need for getting data 
out of a set. That's because if all values are 
unique, and if their order does not matter, then 
there is no point of retrieving values out of a set.
All we need to know is whether a certain value is in 
the set or not. And that's why we have the has method.
If your goal is to actually store values in order and 
then retrieve it, then the best use case, is to just 
use an array. You wouldn't use a set for that. And so 
again, there's no need for getting values out of a set,
because if you need it, then you will just use an array.
